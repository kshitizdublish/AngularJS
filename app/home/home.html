        {{homeCtrl.myName}} Esko was the result of a merger between Barco Graphics and Purup Eskofot in 2002.[3] The merged company was called Esko-Graphics but was renamed Esko in 2006. In the fall of 2005, Esko became fully owned by Axcel A/S, a Danish private equity investment company.[4]

        In August 2007 Esko announced that it was 'joining forces' [5] with Artwork Systems Group NV (AWS), its chief competitor in the packaging prepress market.[6] Esko initially bought 76.69% of AWS shares for â‚¬196 million.[7] Enfocus, a brand of PDF pre-flighting and workflow software originally acquired by Artwork Systems in 2000, became a subsidiary of the combined EskoArtwork company.[8]

        Reflecting the merger, Esko changed its name to EskoArtwork. It also introduced a new logo, though it is visually very close to the Esko original.

        In January 2011, 100% of EskoArtwork shares have been transferred to Danaher.[9] In January 2012, the name changed back to Esko, the logo was also updated.

        Esko is headquartered in Ghent, Belgium.
